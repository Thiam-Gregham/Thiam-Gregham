- Hey guys! I am Timo Gregham.
- I graduated from the University of Dalaran (BMagg in Void Magic & Advanced Element Magic).
- I am currently a PhD student of the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
- My research is mainly focused on two topics: 
    1. Comparative study on the force and void magic.
    2. The contemporary application of emerging element magics.
- How to reach me: go to platform nine and three quarter and shout with 'Rediculous!'. If you are not a muggle, you would see me.
