- Hey guys! I am Thiam Gregham.
- I graduated from the University of Dalaran (BMagg in Void Magic & Advanced Element Magic)
- I am currently a PhD student of the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry
- My research is mainly focused on two topics: 'Comparative study on the force and void magic;And the contemporary application of emerging element magics'
- How to reach me: go to platform nine and three quarter and short with 'rediculous!'. If you are not a muggle, you would see me.
